## Consuming Spring Flo

Refer to the https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-flo/wiki[wiki] for more information on how to embed it in an application.

## Build

Spring Flo is built using Grunt. Grunt commands can be run directly or indirectly through maven. Simplest way to build is via `mvn clean package` to build the project and run the tests.  Build results are produced under the __dist__ folder. Contents of the folder are 

* __spring-flo.js__ that contains all JS code from various JS dev modules (produced by development build)
* __spring-flo.min.js__ a minified version of __flo.js__ (produced by production build)
* __spring-flo.css__ concatenated CSS file for Flo Editor
* __spring-flo.min.css__ minified version of the CSS above
